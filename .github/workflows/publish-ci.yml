# This workflow will build an electron application using npm and then publish it to GitHub Packages when a release is created.
# It updates the version in package.json for each release with a pre-release identifier based on the current date,
# and uploads the built artifacts (in this case, .dmg files) as an upload artifact.
# For more information, see: https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md
