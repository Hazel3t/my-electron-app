A proof-of-concept desktop application using Electron that enables users to execute predefined MongoDB `find` queries and view the results in JSON format. The application will be hosted in a GitHub repository, where the source code will be managed and integrated with a CI/CD pipeline configured through GitHub Actions to automate building and testing processes. The Electron app will establish a connection to a specific MongoDB instance without allowing configurable connection strings, ensuring simplicity and focus on the core functionality of running queries and displaying their outcomes. This project aims to provide hands-on experience with Electron for desktop development, MongoDB integration, and the implementation of automated deployment workflows using GitHub Actions.
